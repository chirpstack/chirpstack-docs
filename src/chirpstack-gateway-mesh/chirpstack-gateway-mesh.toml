  # are transparently proxied between the ChirpStack MQTT Forwarder and

  # Event sets (can be repeated).
  #
  # This configures sets of events that will be periodically sent by the

  # Commands.
  #
  # On receiving a command, the Gateway Mesh will execute the command matching
  # the command type (128 - 255 is for proprietary commands). The payload will
  # be provided to the command using stdin. The returned stdout will be sent
  # back as event (using the same type). Example:
  #
  #   "129" = ["/path/to/command", "arg1", "arg2"]
