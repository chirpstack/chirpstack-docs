# Changelog

## v4.1.0

### Features

#### Events / commands

##### Refactor Mesh heartbeat

This refactors the Gateway Mesh heartbeat payload into a more generic Mesh Event
payload, which can be used by both "known" and "proprietary" event types. The
first implemented "known" type is the heartbeat. While this refactor is not
backwards compatible and requires [ChirpStack MQTT Forwarder](https://www.chirpstack.io/docs/chirpstack-mqtt-forwarder/)
v4.4+, the backwards incompatibility does not affect the functioning of the
Gateway Mesh itself.

##### Proprietary events

This release adds configuration options to periodically send Relay events.
These events can generated by commands that are periodically executed. See
the configuration section for more information.

##### Proprietary commands

Next to events, this release also makes it possible to remotely execute
commands on the Relay gateways, by using MQTT. See the configuration section
for more information.

#### ZMQ API

This aligns the Concentratord ZMQ API interface with the ChirpStack
Concentratord v4.5+. Please make sure to update to this Concentratord
version or later. For Border Gateways, please make sure to also update the
ChirpStack MQTT Forwarder to v4.4 or later.
