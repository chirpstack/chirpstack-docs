## Building from source

The easiest way to get started is by using the provided
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) environment. This environment
comes with all dependencies pre-installed. To start a bash shell within the
docker-compose environment, execute the following command from the root of this
project:

```bash
make devshell
```

For a list of available make commands that can be executed, please consult the
`Makefile` that can be found in the root of each component.
