# C# examples

* [Call gRPC services with the .NET client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/grpc/client?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

## Preparation

Need to install several NuGet packages:

* Chirpstack.Api
* Grpc.Net.Client.Web

## Enqueue

The example below demonstrates:

* Configuration of gRPC _dial options_ including API token
* Connect to a gRPC API
* Define service client (in this case for the `DeviceService`)
* Perform an API call for a service (in this case `Enqueue`)

### `Program.cs`

```csharp
{% raw %}{{#include ../../../examples/chirpstack/api/csharp/Program.cs}}{%endraw %}
```
